Hi guys, this was a very basic question asked on steganography in HeroCTF.

Have a look.

# List of tools i tried using on this png.
pngcheck, strings, exiftool, binwalk, hexedit.
None of them gave any information. 
Then i went to online steg solving sites and using LSB half i could see the flag written diagonally.
