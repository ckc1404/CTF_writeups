We are given a challenge.py file containing a partial flag and some encrypted text. The encrypted text is obtained by a xor of the flag and a key which is redacted. We can get the key by using the given 7 characters of the flag and the encrypted text which gives us the key "1337key".

Use this key to decrypt the encrypted text using solve.py

`Flag: n00bz{pl4y1ng_w1th_x0r_m0r3_l1k3_pl4y1ng_w1th_f1r3}`
