### Chal Desc: 
I bought a new keyboard, but it looks like it's typing gibberish!
My keyboard's not broken, I just need to get used to it.
It uses a different layout from most keyboards.


### File attached: 

### Soln:

It turns out that on searching for different layouts on Google, we find an image where the "Cy" of cipher text used in Dvorak becomes "It" in Querty which lookes somewhat correct.
Hence, on decrypting entire ciphertext we get:

```cipher
It turns out this keyboard uses the Dvorak layout! It really messes up my muscle memory. The flag is bcactf{k3yb0ard_lay0u7_chang3up_qwerty}
```

Thank you
