### Chal Desc: 

Seems like in their haste to deliver a secret message to the Army's first blind soldier, someone forgot braille doesn't translate well to a digital medium...
Help them decode this message! (And don't forget, encoding is most definitely not encryption!)

#### File attached: 
[Cryptogram.txt]()

#### Soln:
Converted the Braille to Ascii, and take the first letter for each word, EXCEPT for the numbers, and comma

I used this site : https://www.brailletranslator.org/

Output i got: 

```java
charlie tango foxtrot uniform alfa ;7three november charlie romeo yankee papa tango three delta comma _tango hotel one sierra _india sierra _november zero tango 72
```

Thank you
