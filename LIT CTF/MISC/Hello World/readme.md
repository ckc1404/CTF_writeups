### Chall Desc :
Here's an easy CTF problem for demonstration purposes. I will go get some caesar salad while you solve this.

### File content : 
```
YVGPGS{J3yp0z3_G0_Y1GPGS}
```

### Soln : 

Another simple challenge, we need to decrypt the ciphertext with caesar cipher. Using dcode.fr, we get the flag.

#### THE FLAG : LITCTF{W3lc0m3_T0_L1TCTF}
