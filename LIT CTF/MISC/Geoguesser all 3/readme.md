### WARM UP
```
Warm-up (LITCTF{36.122,-5.350}) - The sign on the left almost certainly belongs to a pub (Arms in the name, the font) and the sign on the wall belongs to the British beer brand Bass.  
If you squint you should even be able to see "Supplies Ltd" at the end of the next sign too, implying that this is in an English speaking territory.   
The most significant British territory with a Southern European, temperate climate is Gibraltar.   
Google gibraltar + pub + arms to find the Edinburgh Arms. 
```

### NORMAL MODE
```
Normal: (LITCTF{22.189,113.539}): The sign in the foreground is written in both Portuguese and Chinese, meaning that 
this is almost definitely Macau, a former Portuguese colony in China - especially because of the prominent skyline.
Find the most significant landmark in the image, the skyscraper with the red orb on top,
by browsing Macau's tallest buildings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Macau, number 11) 
then appproximate where the image was taken from.
```

### HARD MODE
```
Hard: ( LITCTF{13.775,-13.669}) This is extremely likely in a current or former French colony in Africa, 
judging by the Pan-African colors being painted on both the tree and the power station to the left, 
the fact that "Hotel de Ville" is the French name for a town hall, the climate and vegetation and there being a Sub-Saharan African man visible in the background. 
You could approximate the country by sifting through "hotel de ville" + every African country with those colors in their flag, ending up with Senegal, 
but with the right crop Google Lens actually shows you several news articles confirming that this is in Tambacounda, Senegal.
Find the location manually with street view, it's not a big place.
