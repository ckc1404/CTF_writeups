### Chall Desc : 
```
We would like to say a huge thank you to Rythm and Eyangch for their massive support.   
Not only did they write many of the high quality problems, but they also helped us greatly in the process of hosting CTF.  
They are from the team PeanutButter.jar and are actually hosting their own CTF competition in August.   
If you haven't already, you should definitely
