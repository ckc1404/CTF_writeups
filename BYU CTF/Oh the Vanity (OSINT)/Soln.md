### Chal Desc:

The vanity and audacity of these scammers and their phishing attacks are just getting ridiculous. I read an article this month about a new way to mask phishing campaigns. They even included this photo. Find the date the article was published.

Soln: 
The image looks very peculiar with masks on faces of fish.
When we google the image, there are a lot of sites available showing related things. But what we are concerned is basically mask phishing.

Therefore when we try to search the image with keywords like "Vanity" or "Phishing". We get a webpage named Vanity Url....

The date year and month is given there. Have a look at the [webpage](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/vanity-urls-could-be-spoofed-for-social-engineering-attacks)
