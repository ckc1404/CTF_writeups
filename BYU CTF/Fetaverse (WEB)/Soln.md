### Chal Desc:  
Come explore the fetaverse of cheesy puns and pics. It's an un-brie-lievably well-designed site!

### Website Link: http://fetaverse.byuctf.xyz

Soln:  
When we go to the site, it seems a quite detailed one. On looking at website sources, we find there are libraries in the HTML.

On browsing, we find that it is open source.

we look at http://fetaverse.byuctf.xyz/library but nothing relevant in there.
There is an img directory also and our chal desc also points towards it.

On browsing http://fetaverse.byuctf.xyz/img
We find some folders and jpgs in it and in the meme folder there is an exceptionally large jpg attached which gives us the flag named meme7.jpg.
On opening that we find the cheesy man alongwith the flag.

Flag: byuctf{welc0me_t0_the_fetaverse}
