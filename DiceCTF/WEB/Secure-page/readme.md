### Chall Desc : 
My new website uses cookies for authentication. Now nobody can get in! secure-page.mc.ax

### Files attached : 
[server.py](server.py)
[app.py](Ap.py)

#### Soln : 
This was a simple problem of cookie value.
We are shown in the web page that `Secure Page
Sorry, you must be the admin to view this content!`

Therefore, we inspect using developers tool and set the cookie value to true from false and refresh the webpage.

#### THE FLAG : hope{signatures_signatures_signatures}

Thank you
