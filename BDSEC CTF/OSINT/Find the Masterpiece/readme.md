### Chall Desc :

My friend gave me the following stream of numbers and told me to figure out something of it. He gave me a hint that, the thing hidden behind the numbers is very known to me and piano keys might help me to solve the challenge. He also claimed that it is a master piece. So, he also asked for the creation date of that master piece. Please help me to solve that mistery!

```

Flag Format: BDSEC{name_of_the_master_piece,year}

Special note: All the letter of the flag are lower case and there will be a special character in the flag unlike the other challenge flags.


### Soln : 

In this challenge, we are given some numbers and given piano keys might help. 
So the master piece must be a song.

I tried searching the note with piano notes and got a youtube link with the same numbers.

It showed me a way to play pirates of carribean famous song on phone keypad.

This hints that the song is from pirates of carribean.

After some searched, we find out that the song tune is of He's a Pirate by Klaus Badelt and the year is 2003.

Therefore, 

#### THE FLAG : BDSEC{He's_a_Pirate,2003}
