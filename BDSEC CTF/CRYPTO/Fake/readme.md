### Soln :

It was a very simple question related to spam cipher. After some googling we get a link 
https://www.spammimic.com/decode.shtml which is for spam decode.

On decoding our cipher text, we get our flag.

Decoded message : Hello Mr.Alex   I won't 100000 M USD dolor. Can  you want that, you need this key   BDSEC{do3sn't_b3li3ve_1n_unkn0wn_mail} 

#### THE FLAG : BDSEC{do3sn't_b3li3ve_1n_unkn0wn_mail}

Thank you
